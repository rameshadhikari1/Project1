# Road Accidents in Austin
Thid repository contains all components of the end-to-end capstone project predicting
the number of auto accidents in specified time and space in Austin city. The contents
of the repository includes: ipynb files for each sections and pdf files for each of
final report and final presentation. 

The project includes generating project idea, data collection, statistical inferential
analysis, exploratory data analysis, accident forecast using time series analysis, and
predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms. Number of accidents in particular
time and space was forecasted using auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA).
Supervised machine learning algorithms were also used to predict the number of auto
accidents in city of Austin. Two decision tree based algorithms, Random Forest(RF) and
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were implemented. XGB was found to perform the best
with upto 90% accuracy (based on mean absolute error).
