# Road Accidents in Austin
Thid repository contains all components of the end-to-end capstone project predicting<br>
the number of auto accidents in specified time and space in Austin city. The contents <br>
of the repository includes: ipynb files for each sections and pdf files for each of<br>
final report and final presentation. 

The project includes generating project idea, data collection, statistical inferential<br>
analysis, exploratory data analysis, accident forecast using time series analysis, and<br>
predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms. Number of accidents in particular<br>
time and space was forecasted using auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA).<br>
Supervised machine learning algorithms were also used to predict the number of auto<br>
accidents in city of Austin. Two decision tree based algorithms, Random Forest(RF) and<br>
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), were implemented. XGB was found to perform the best <br>
with upto 90% accuracy (based on mean absolute error).
